# Introduction

## About

Welcome to the manual of the [Poppy-Project](https://www.poppy-project.org/), an open-source robotic platform.

In this documentation, we will try to cover everything from the short overview of what is possible within the project to the details on how you can build a Poppy robot or reproduce one of the pedagogical activity.

In the first chapter, we will give you a simple but exhaustive overview of what you can do within this project, so you can quickly focus on the following chapters that cover what you are really interested in. While some advanced chapters may require a good understanding of mechanics, electronics or computer sciences, the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section is intended to be easily accessible by all readers.
